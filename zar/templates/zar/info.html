  <h2>Zoom Attendance Report Aggregator</h2>

  <h3>What does it do?</h3>
  <p>
    This is a tool for aggregating your zoom attendance reports into a single
    report that is actually useful to you. If you didn't already know, you
    can export a report of the "usage," from your zoom meetings (aka who
    attended and for how long). That's pretty nifty, but who really wants
    to sort through all that data, filter out students' weird inaccurate zoom
    names, and compile a longitudinal report of students' attendance over time?
  </p>
  <p>
    This website, that's who.
  </p>


  <h3>What does "the report" look like?</h3>
  <p>
    <a 
     href="{% static 'zar/sample-report.xlsx' %}"
     download="SampleReport.xlsx"
     >Here is a sample report</a>
    that I generated with my own meet data this year so far.
  </p>

  <h3>How can I use this if I don't have excel?</h3>
  <p>
    Excel is not installed on anyone's work computer, but you can upload
    the excel file this website gives you to google drive and view it there
    instead.

      >This</a>
    is what the report looks like in google sheets.

  <h3>Who made this?</h3>
  <p>
    I made this! I'm Jack DeVries, I am the music teacher at UES, and
    computer programming is my hobby. My job is just too fun, I had to choose
    a boring hobby – that's the rule.
  </p>

  <h3>Will this work for LES?</h3>
  <p>
    Not currently because I personally don't have access to student data for
    LES since I am a UES teacher, but if somebody wants to give me access,
    I can easily make it work for LES later.
  </p>


  <h3>Will this work if I use the same meet topic for all my Zooms?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes! That is actually where this tool shines the most. If you are a teacher
    who has been using the same meet topic to meet with different groups of
    students, it would be a nightmare for you to try to disaggregate all
    your meet reports from zoom and make any use out of them. This tool can
    actually dynamically group meetings based on the overlap of students
    between different meeting instances.
  </p>
  <p>
    In plainer terms, that means that if you used the meet topic "Smith Music"
    to meet with every homeroom in every grade, this tool will group together
    each homeroom and print them separately on the final report.
  </p>


  <h3>Will this work if my students use incorrect names in Zoom?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes! Again, this is one of the intended use cases of this tool. It will
    agressively try to match the student's zoom name with the student's
    real profile. First it will try an exact full name match. If that fails,
    it performs an approximate name match. If that fails to return a
    sufficiently confdent match, it will try to match the first name to a
    first name in the group it presumes to currently be looking at.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>
      For example, if all the attendees of the meeting currently being parsed
      are in Mrs. Smith's homeroom and we encounter a student named "Jimmy
      Fortnite Rules Forever," The program will first break that atrocious
      name into four separate parts:
      <code>['Jimmy', 'Fortnite'...].</code>
      Then, it will try to find a first-name-match within Mrs. Smith's
      homeroom for each word. If there is only one "Jimmy" in Mrs. Smith's
      homeroom, we have a match.
    </i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>
      Suffice it to say, the script will match almost any name that a human
      could have.
    </b>
    Key word "almost." After all is said and done, you will be brought to a
    skippable screen where you can manually match any stragglers. The
    system also gets smarter over time, so the straggler-to-name conversion
    that you input is saved and potentially used by the next person so they
    don't have to do as much manual matching.
  </p>


  <h3>Is this Safe?</h3>
  <p>
    I used a
    <a
      href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/security/"
      >web framework called Django</a>
    that includes all of the security features of any modern website. Cross
    site scripting protection, cross site request forgery tokens, SQL injection
    protection, clickjacking protection, encryption, password hashing, and more
    are all implemented here.
  </p>
  <p>
    Plus, you cannot make an account or do anything here unless you have been
    verified to have access to an @empacad.org email address, and no, students
    cannot gain access with their accounts either.
  </p>


  <h3>How does this work?</h3>
  <p>
    You haven't used it yet, maybe it doesn't...
  </p>
  <p>
    For the curious among us, code for the website is
    <a
      href="https://github.com/jdevries3133/ea_internal_tools"
      >here</a>
    , and the report generator is
    <a 
      href="https://github.com/jdevries3133/teacher-helper/blob/master/teacherHelper/zoom_attendance_report.py"
      >here.</a>
